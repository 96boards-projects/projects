# 1. Contribution Guidelines

Before contributing please take a look at the [FAQ](FAQ.md) guide. 

## 1.1 Project Idea

The project submission begins with getting the project idea approved by our
96Boards team. This happens by raising a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/96boards-projects/staging/issues)
using the following guidelines.

* **Use a clear and crispy title** for your project.
* **Provide a detailed description** for your project.
* **Justify the showcasing of 96Boards functionalities** in your project

After getting approval from one of the members of 96Boards team, proceed to
next step.

## 1.2 Project Format

Please follow the format specified in [Project Submission Template](./template/README.md).

Source code should contain the Copyright of author with the
[MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) license.

## 1.3 Project Submission

Once your project is structured into above format, please initiate the
submission process by submitting a 
[Pull Request](https://github.com/96boards-projects/staging/pull/new/master).

One of our 96Boards team member will review your project and comment on it if
required. Once it got approved, your pull request will be merged into the
staging repository and later migrated to [96Boards Projects Org](https://github.com/96boards-projects).
Then the author of the project will be assigned as the owner for that
repository. From there on, the author is responsible for keeping their
repo updated.

## 1.4 Code of Conduct

Since, we grant the author full rights to their projects repository, he/she
will be part of our 96Boards ecosystem and hence it is their due responsibility
to keep the content updated and in good shape.

If any of the author found breaching this code of conduct they will be immediately
removed from the ownership and their project will be **deleted** from the 96Boards
Projects Org without any further due.

Also, we expect the author to respond to github issues opened against their
project and keep the content up to date.

## 2. Reporting Bugs

Bugs are tracked through [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).
Issues should be created in the appropriate project repository and the following
information should be provided.

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
* **Mention the platform** where issue is found.
